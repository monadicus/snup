# snups

This project aims to provide guides and scripts for managing Aleo `snarkOS` nodes and participating in Aleo Foundation's CanaryNet.


# Aleo Guides and How-Tos

Today, MONADIC.US's `snarkops` is enabled to support Aleo `snarkOS` nodes and related infrastructure.  To better support Aleo system administrators, we're providing a guide for how Aleo nodes are configured and administered in different environments.  While these are not `snarkops` specific guides, they provide insight into how `snarkOS` is used as well as how Aleo networks are created.
